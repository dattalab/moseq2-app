The target duration can be determined using change-points analysis or set heuristically to 0.3-0.4 seconds based on prior literature. In the code below, set `kappa` to `'scan'` to run a family of models with different `kappa` values and use the \"Get Best Model Fit\" cell to pick an optimal value. We recommend fitting for 100-200 iterations to pick `kappa`. For final model fitting, set `kappa` to the chosen value and fit for ~1000 iterations. \n",
