<!---Need to check the moseq pipeline image and see if there is any copy right issue. We could/probably should make our own-->
The MoSeq2 toolkit enables users to model mouse behavior across different experimental groups, and
measure the differences between their behavior usages, durations, transition patterns. etc.

This package contains functionalities that can be used interactively in jupyter notebooks. 
We provide a series of Jupyter Notebooks that cover the entire MoSeq pipeline to process their depth videos of mice, and segment their behavior into what is denoted as "syllables".

<!---
All colab notebooks right now are temporarily shared from my Google drive. 
Users will get the "click one link and everything works" experience once the notebooks are public on Github. 
--> 
Consult the wiki page for more detailed documentation of the MoSeq pipeline [here](https://github.com/dattalab/moseq2-app/wiki).
You can try MoSeq on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JOFvvUIfQlhjWZ3MZ3yZ0_hryhI-u55U?usp=sharing) on our test data or your data on Google Drive.

# [Documentation: MoSeq2 Wiki](https://github.com/dattalab/moseq2-app/wiki)
You can find more information about MoSeq Pipeline, step-by-step instructions, documentation for Command Line Interface(CLI), tutorials etc in [MoSeq2 Wiki](https://github.com/dattalab/moseq2-app/wiki).

# Installation
Installing MoSeq2 and the dependencies requires **Python version 3.7, gcc-7 and g++-7**. We recommend using our conda environment yaml file to install MoSeq. Run the following to clone the repository and install MoSeq2 and the Jupyter extensions:
<!---Current branch is dev but will update that to release later.-->
```bash
git clone -b dev https://github.com/dattalab/moseq2-app.git
cd moseq2-app
conda create -n moseq2-app --file scripts/moseq2-env.yaml
./scripts/install_moseq2_app.sh
```
### We provide step-by-step guides for installing MoSeq in a conda environment or Docker in the wiki [here](https://github.com/dattalab/moseq2-app/wiki/MoSeq2-Installation).

# Test data and Colab Demo
You can try the entire MoSeq pipeline on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JOFvvUIfQlhjWZ3MZ3yZ0_hryhI-u55U?usp=sharing) using the test data. 
If you want to try the test data locally, you can find the test data and their descriptions [here](https://github.com/dattalab/moseq2-app/wiki/Download-Test-Data). 
<!---Maybe put some crowd movies here?-->
